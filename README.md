# Intro-OOD
This repository houses the source used to build the article
"An Introduction to Object-Oriented Design"

This is currently a working draft of the document which I plan
to finish at some point in the near future. I abandoned this
writing project back in April, but I will come back and revise
it, as well as add some more content, once I finish the other
projects I'm working on at the moment.
